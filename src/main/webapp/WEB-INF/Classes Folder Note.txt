The /classes/ folder needs specified here as a HARD LINK.

The real folder exists at /target/classes

This is done because PrettyFaces assumes the /classes/ folder is inside of WEB-INF/classes or WEB-INF/lib.

Spring Boot w/ an embedded tomcat server doesn't have this property. If I packaged as a WAR and deployed to a static Tomcat server, PrettyFaces would work.
